### 10/24

- Look at pages 320(ish) in Query Alternative paper
- Learn about Positive relations and Negative relations and how they correlate to the
  dependency-style graphs that are used for knowledge theory
- Goal: Understand the P/N *inferences* from the paper. This will save us many permutations of QUERYs
### 10/17

- Finish terms, decide to move on, working with what we have
- build pokemon knowledge space
- goal now is to start implementing a basic quiz based on this space

### 10/10

Solidify terms from aleks paper (see terms.md)

### 10/3

Ren is sick

### 9/26

- Learn how to read the graphs in the aleks paper (Figure 2)
- Physically draw out a pokemon graph

### 9/19

- Figure out how to encode the results of the test
- Figure out how to update the knowledge space graph

### 9/12

- Find a graph implementation that works for us
- Write up a quiz in pokemon
- Find a good, serialized output
