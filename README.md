# knowledge-spaces

A python implementation of knowledge spaces for Utah Tech Undergraduate Research

## Challenges

- How do we use the results of a test to update a student's knowledge space?
    - How should we represent the result of the test?
    - How do we store the knowledge space?
- Should spelling accuracy impact score? If so, how much?
  - Is this unimportant due to a large question pool?
